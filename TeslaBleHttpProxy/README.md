# Tesla Ble Http Proxy

Tesla BLE Http Proxy exposes Tesla vehicle api over BLE. This addon is meant as a
standalone instance of the proxy and is not needed for TeslaBle2Mqtt addon.

This is only exposing the api for use with [evcc](https://evcc.io/) or other applications that make use of this api.
